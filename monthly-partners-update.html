              Frontline Worship Center (FWC) continues to expand its reach into
              the cities and far-flung communities with its unstoppable house

              the Word and worship together. FWC also celebrates the Lord’s
              financial provision through a recent donation for the development
              of the Training Center (formerly Frontline’s Threadworks). The
              former sewing factory has been jokingly called the “pastor
              factory”, where workers and leaders are able to gather and
              continue to learn about church-planting. Inspired by what the Lord
              is doing through FWC, a global church-planting organization has
              recently featured FWC in a gathering organized in London. Praise
              God!

              outdoor garden, where she gathers 20-30 people. She prepares food
              to share, and leads enthusiastically in worship. Her eyes are dim
              but the fire in her heart is undeniable as she powerfully shares
              the Word, and lays hands on the sick. She is witness to many
              miracles in her lifetime, including her doctor’s announcement that
              the 27cm colon tumor removed from her in 2017 was benign. The
              doctor was so amazed that he asked Nanay Juliet to pray for him!

              Much has happened at Face the Children (FTC) in the last few
              months. With the government still prohibiting anyone 15 years old
              and under from leaving their homes, it has been challenging to
              find creative ways to keep the children busy and happy. They are
              blessed to have a beautiful, safe community to live in, but they
              still miss things like going swimming, going to the mall, and
              visiting friends. They also miss visiting teams that annually
              visit Frontline, but haven’t since the covid situation.

              So, almost every afternoon, the children, staff and some other
              Frontline community residents play volleyball. Twice a month, the
              staff host a game of “Snack Bingo” where the winning children are
              given snacks as prizes. Daily, some of the older children/
              teenagers are assigned to lead groups in prayer and devotion. It

              normal day in the boys’ dorm where he lived, Daddy Ronnie didn’t
              wake up for morning coffee. This was traumatic for the little boys
              who witnessed it. He was a kind and loving father figure. Many of
              the children are still grieving. His death, declared a covid
              death, required tests to be done on the kids and staff, and 6
              tested positive (all asymptomatic). This sent the entire refuge
              center into an even stricter lockdown, where the kids weren’t
              allowed to leave the dorms. Add to that the harassment of the
              local village officials because of the stigma surrounding covid,
              and it would seem that many of the children were at their
              emotional breaking points.

              Thank God for loving friends and family. Through some connections,
              a registered Christian counsellor visited the children for 3
              weeks. She was able to counsel the kids and conduct workshops and
              seminars with the staff and management.

              leaving home, FCA improvised, and held its first ever Online
              Graduation and Recognition Ceremony. Our bus and some of the staff
              showed up at their homes to award diplomas — The stage was a

              The online schooling situation has taken a heavy toll on students’
              overall well-being. We need wisdom navigating these uncharted
              waters with the pandemic population (as they are now called). It
              seems that schools will remain closed for another year. This is
              extremely sad, and seems unnecessary; but there is nothing we can
              do but keep trying to

              situation, FCA looks forward to the next school year. Partnering
              with another youth development organization, the school will be
              leaning even more on Social Emotional Learning (SEL). Our
              marketing plan aims to double our current student population, and
              we have made important adjustments to meet the holistic needs of
              students and their family members. We also hope to provide
              periodic counseling sessions for students. Perhaps you’d like to
              partner in making this happen; sessions cost roughly $25 each.

              closures of 2020 literally wiped out our financial projections. We
              are grateful that through God’s wisdom, creativity, and caring,
              generous partners, we remain open. Very recently the Lord also
              provided funds to ensure we can keep meeting our monthly mortgage

              have to teach primarily online, are in need of 15 computers
              (roughly $300 each), and we need to finish the security fencing
              around the school property, which requires another $10,000.

                <p class="mb-30">
                  Many years ago I met another missionary who asked about our
                  mission. When I explained the team nature of Frontline, he
                  dismissively commented, “We don’t do teams anymore, because
                  we’ve learned ‘teams’ don’t work,” and walked away.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-30">
                  I was startled to say the least. But it only took me a few
                  minutes to reject his idea, knowing that even Jesus had a
                  team. And though it isn’t always easy or perfect, teams do
                  work. Author John Maxwell has long posited that nothing of
                  significance is ever accomplished by lone, disconnected,
                  individuals; that all great achievements have always been the
                  result of teamwork.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-30">
                  The Frontline is a team effort. And the team extends well
                  beyond the Philippines, because it includes prayer and
                  financial partners. We are a true “faith-based” mission, and
                  could never do what we do without our distant partners. Thank
                  you again for being a part of the vision and the mission of
                  Frontline. The pandemic has brought us truly unexpected and
                  serious challenges in operations and finance. Please continue
                  to pray with us for miracles of provision.

              Frontline Worship Center (FWC) continues to expand its reach into
              the cities and far-flung communities with its unstoppable house
              church movement. FWC churches are gathering in homes, near

              mountains, and even in the forest areas to share and experience
              the Word and worship together. FWC also celebrates the Lord’s
              financial provision through a recent donation for the development
              of the Training Center (formerly Frontline’s Threadworks). The
              former sewing factory has been jokingly called the “pastor
              factory”, where workers and leaders are able to gather and
              continue to learn about church-planting. Inspired by what the Lord
              is doing through FWC, a global church-planting organization has
              recently featured FWC in a gathering organized in London. Praise
              God!

              Every Saturday, cane in hand, she slowly hobbles to her small
              outdoor garden, where she gathers 20-30 people. She prepares food
              to share, and leads enthusiastically in worship. Her eyes are dim
              but the fire in her heart is undeniable as she powerfully shares
              the Word, and lays hands on the sick. She is witness to many
              miracles in her lifetime, including her doctor’s announcement that
              the 27cm colon tumor removed from her in 2017 was benign. The
              doctor was so amazed that he asked Nanay Juliet to pray for him!
              Despite her age, she is a faithful and faithfilled firecracker,
              passionately sharing the gospel to the lost, to “reach and help
              people find their way back to God.”

              Much has happened at Face the Children (FTC) in the last few
              months. With the government still prohibiting anyone 15 years old
              and under from leaving their homes, it has been challenging to
              find creative ways to keep the children busy and happy. They are
              blessed to have a beautiful, safe community to live in, but they
              still miss things like going swimming, going to the mall, and
              visiting friends. They also miss visiting

              Frontline community residents play volleyball. Twice a month, the
              staff host a game of “Snack Bingo” where the winning children are
              given snacks as prizes. Daily, some of the older children/
              teenagers are assigned to lead groups in prayer and devotion. It

              normal day in the boys’ dorm where he lived, Daddy Ronnie didn’t
              wake up for morning coffee. This was traumatic for the little boys
              who witnessed it. He was a kind and loving father figure. Many of
              the children are still grieving. His death, declared a covid
              death, required tests to be done on the kids and staff, and 6
              tested positive (all asymptomatic). This sent the entire refuge
              center into an even stricter lockdown, where the kids weren’t
              allowed to leave the dorms. Add to that the harassment of the
              local village officials because of the stigma surrounding covid,
              and it would seem that many of the children were at their
              emotional breaking points.

              a registered Christian counsellor visited the children for 3
              weeks. She was able to counsel the kids and conduct workshops and
              seminars with the staff and management.
